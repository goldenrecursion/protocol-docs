# Golden Protocol FAQ

### Status and progress

Golden is on a mission to map all human knowledge.&#x20;

We [started](https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/) as a [web2 company](https://golden.com/wiki/Golden-5R) in San Francisco. We [raised $20m](https://golden.com/blog/golden-raises-14-5m-series-a-led-by-a16z/) from leading investors ranging from a16z to Balaji to Founders Fund and many others. Since the Fall 2021, we have been ramping up efforts to create a web3 version of Golden to increase the speed that the knowledge graph can be built.&#x20;

Golden is building a permissionless, open source [protocol](https://golden.xyz/) that incentivizes the collection and verification of canonical knowledge, which it will offer to the public for free and charge commercial entities.

**User growth:** 10’s of thousands of users (growing daily) have connected wallets to Golden and are submitting data into the protocol.

**Data collection:** users have contributed millions of data triples to Golden so far, and we have started the process of the verification of these triples.

**Protocol development:** We are developing a protocol, [dApp](https://dapp.golden.xyz/), and APIs for submitting and verifying triples. [Golden.com](http://golden.com) is in the process of being optimized for full web3 integration.

**Whitepaper:** We have written our whitepaper, which is currently in review to be made public soon.

**Hiring:** We are hiring fast and have [many open roles](https://www.notion.so/Golden-Careers-Public-c19e625ad4874be8b845b756ee1b0252). Please apply or share.

### I am new here, how can I help?

1. Start by [creating an account on Golden.com](https://golden.com/signup) and following the guide for [Connecting a Wallet to Golden.com](https://www.notion.so/Connecting-a-Wallet-to-Golden-com-8cc2addc89f14e8eab4c6d522fada13c) ([settings](https://golden.com/settings/profile) → connect wallet). If you have already made a Golden.com account, just connect your wallet.
2. Help grow the knowledge graph by [adding data triples and citations](https://www.notion.so/Adding-Structured-Data-Guide-ae657337bf4f4e54ae4402df083c76ac) to [Golden.com](http://golden.com) entity pages. Follow our [Adding Structured Data Guide](https://www.notion.so/Adding-Structured-Data-Guide-ae657337bf4f4e54ae4402df083c76ac) to get started.
   1. **Submit triples:** Users that submit fact triples that go on to be accepted will be eligible for an airdrop when the Golden token is released. _Please note, there is no need to paste edits of data triples and citations into Discord, we have a log of your efforts!_
   2. **Verify triples:** Users can become eligible for a future airdrop by verifying triples that get accepted by the protocol on [dapp.golden.xyz](http://dapp.golden.xyz). Please follow our [Triple Verification Guide](https://docs.golden.xyz/protocol/guides/triple-validation-guide) when verifying.
3. Are you a builder (developer, data scientist etc.) that can help us? Let us know in Discord by [introducing yourself](https://discord.com/channels/900818355315961876/920015042471133204).
4. Share the project! Tell your friends, developers, or family. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/28QcktsGmG) and invite like-minded people to [golden.xyz](https://golden.xyz).

### **What’s the TLDR on how the protocol works?**

1. **Tokens for submission and verification:** Tokens are earned by submitters and verifiers for loading and verifying true facts (triples) into the knowledge graph. E.g. _‘Apple’ ‘was founded in’ ‘1976’_. Verifiers confirm the correctness of the triples by voting. Once the number of votes reaches a statistical threshold, the ‘fact’ is accepted by the knowledge graph and immutably stored. As the knowledge graph grows, the data itself can be used to aid verification. Submitters and verifiers gain a reputation score as triples are accepted.
2. **Data NFTs, fractional ownership, and revenue share incentives:** NFTs are used to organize fractional ownership between the creators of the data associated with each unique entity. Various canonical data can be associated with the unique data NFTs including triples, natural language in various translations, canonical images, or otherwise. These NFTs will assist with disambiguation and allow fractionalized ownership for the submitters, verifiers, and the protocol. Revenue shared from commercial data usage can be distributed to the creators of the data and protocol. Copyright law is used to protect intellectual property and afford commercial usage of the data while allowing free usage by the public.
3. **Anti-gaming:** A Sybil attack resistance, game-theoretic approach is used to provide asymmetric costs to gaming the protocol. Slashing staked collateral is a mechanic used to prevent submitters and verifiers from incorrectly submitting or voting. Reputation scores are implemented to increase efficiency in staking and slashing. Voting is blind.

### When will a token be released?

There is currently no Golden token and no set date for release. The team will clearly communicate this release well in advance of the launch.

⚠️ Important: We will \***never**\* directly message you about the token sale, so please do not interact with any such messages, as they are spam. When we launch the token, we will do so on multiple marketing channels including core discord announcements channels, Twitter, and our blog.

The team is working aggressively towards a mainnet launch. Currently, we are creating our protocol and [dApp](https://dapp.golden.xyz/) on the testnet. We will announce an estimated launch date as we further build the protocol. We are building Golden in an SEC-compliant manner and are not cutting corners with compliance.

### **How will airdrops be awarded?**

At this time, performing the following tasks will make you eligible for an airdrop:

* submitting triples that go on to be accepted
* performing correct verification
* developing the protocol code
* adding a citation to a triple that exists on Golden that doesn’t have a citation already

Up to 1% of the token treasury will be awarded to the community for correct data submission and verification.

### How can I perform triple submission tasks?

You can use our infobox editor [here](https://jmp.sh/UanEHeA) to edit triples. Please follow our [Adding Structured Data Guide](https://www.notion.so/Adding-Structured-Data-Guide-ae657337bf4f4e54ae4402df083c76ac). We are currently _only accepting triples in the English language_, though we plan to expand this as soon as possible.

### How can I perform verification tasks?

The [Triple Verification Guide](https://docs.golden.xyz/protocol/guides/triple-validation-guide) covers mechanics and common questions around verification.

### I have been adding triples, are my efforts being counted?

Yes! You will eligible for an airdrop reward relative to the number of correct triples you have submitted when we launch our token on the mainnet.

**Note**: for additions to be counted towards airdrop rewards they must follow the [Adding Structured Data Guide](https://www.notion.so/Adding-Structured-Data-Guide-ae657337bf4f4e54ae4402df083c76ac) and not attempt to game the protocol.

### I have been adding citations, are my efforts being counted?

Yes! Adding valid citations to any triple that is missing a citation will qualify you for a special airdrop, and will help the triples you have cited become verified. Citations should be focused around triples that are not URL predicates, especially triples added after the launch of [golden.xyz](http://golden.xyz).

### **Will any contribution to** [**golden.com**](http://golden.com) **count for a future airdrop?**

No. We are focused on triples that go on to be verified along with citations for triples. As of February 16, 2022, natural language and prose in articles will not be rewarded. If you still wish to contribute prose, please follow our [Writing Guide](https://www.notion.so/Writing-Guide-1e96be6c4c4742a288a142dbc212248c). We are currently _only accepting prose in the English language_, though we plan to expand this as soon as possible.

### What is the difference between [**Golden.com**](http://golden.com) **and the** [**dApp**](https://dapp.golden.xyz/) **(Golden.xyz)?**

[Golden.com](http://golden.com) is the current place to register your user account, connect your wallet and submit triple data (with citations). The [dApp](https://dapp.golden.xyz/) is a minimal dApp on testnet with a focused UI around verification.

### Initial testnet point rewards will not be included in a future airdrop

The initial testnet point reward that is allocated when users join the dApp is used as an initial staking mechanic by the protocol to enable triple submission and verification. This initial testnet point reward will NOT be considered in a future mainnet airdrop reward. Testnet points are designed to reward users for taking positive actions in the protocol.

### How can I find my position on the leaderboard?

You may be able to find your current position on the leaderboard. If the number of ‘submissions’ and ‘accepted triples’ you see associated with your wallet seem lower than expected, this is because your submissions from [Golden.com](http://golden.com) are still being imported and verifiers still need to vote on them.

### Why is Golden the right team to build this?

Golden’s team has crypto enthusiasts dating back to 2011, some being early users and supporters of BTC. Golden's investors have also been at the heart of many crypto projects we see in the market today.

### **Do I need to paste the edit I have done into Discord?**

No, we have full logs of all edits being made on [Golden.com](http://golden.com) and the [dApp](https://dapp.golden.xyz/).

### **When are other languages going to be supported?**

We want to prove the unit economics and security of the system first in English (the language of our original team). If it works, we want to open up to multiple languages (as it should be!). Please don’t make non-English edits at this point, as we don’t support it yet.

### **I want to be a mod in Discord, how should I approach Golden?**

We are still configuring Discord for mass scale. At this time, please refrain from DMing team members as this will only slow the protocol development down. However, long term, we are interested in mods. If you have experience in this area, please add that to your introduction in the "introductions" channel. We are booting up moderators in a careful way to prevent security issues.

### Can I change the eth account address associated with my [Golden.com](http://golden.com/) account / used to login into dapp.golden.xyz?

You cannot change the eth account address associated with your [golden.com](http://golden.com/) account or that you used to login into dapp.golden.xyz. This would cause issues with how attribution for effort is tracked. To use a new .eth account, please create a new account on [golden.com](http://golden.com/).

We plan to explore how we can help users not lose previous work in the case of wallet hacks, loss of login information, etc., in the context of these technical constraints.
