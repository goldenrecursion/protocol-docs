# Dataset Uploader

Golden's open source project providing users with a no-code method to import datasets to the protocol. 

{% embed url="https://github.com/goldenrecursion/dataset-uploader" %}

This project is reliant on community contributions and is an avenue for *you* to make a difference at Golden. Contribution guidelines and suggested specs are in the repository above. Contributors are awarded proportional to their efforts. 

## Bounty Information

Contributors receive a combination of Milestone Payouts and Participation Payouts. Bounties for both vary depending on the contributions made. Users receive higher payouts if they make major contributions and/or contribute to multiple milestones.

Milestone Payouts are granted after each milestone is reached. Participation Payouts are granted after all Milestones are reached. 

### Payout Levels

**High Contribution: up to 75,000 points**

Contributions leading code development such as programming an in-demand feature. 

**Mid Contribution: up to 35,000 points**

Contributions addressing non-critical features or issues. This can be in the form of enhancing an already existing feature or fixing bugs.

**Low Contribution: up to 2,500 points**

Contributions in the form of issue/bug identification, discussions, and documentation development. Community development like aiding in the rallying of community members (steering repo, meeting organization, social media posts, etc.) will also be considered. 

Bug identification contributions vary on the below. [Referring to Stack Overflowâ€™s guidelines may be helpful.](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)

- Impact of the discovery: 1) minor problem not affecting workflows; 2) medium-scale problem affecting but not impeding workflows **or** minor problem requiring significant effort to fix; and 3) major problem
- How well scoped and researched the problem is, including details of avenues taken, reproduction steps, potential diagnosis, and suggested solutions

Discussion and community development contributions must be:

- Traceable: in either the repository or designated channel in Discord
- Meaningful: Examples include 1) Contribution to an Issue by helping clarify either the problem or recommended solution; or 2) Actively assisting other users by answering questions in the Discord channel

Documentation development: Creating new documentation files that help users understand or contribute to the tool, such as enhancement tracking, coding good practice guidelines, and expansion of README.md to include more core information.

### Milestones and Milestone Payout

Milestones are defined so contributors can set goals and understand project phases and priorities.

**Milestone 1: Building the Foundation**

- *Benchmark: Workable base UI for non-technical users to submit new triples and entities*
- High Contribution: up to 15,000 points
- Mid Contribution: up to 7,000 points
- Low Contribution: up to 500 points  

**Milestone 2: Enabling Accuracy**

- *Benchmark: Ability to disambiguate triples and select a certain disambiguation per entity before submission*
- High Contribution: up to 15,750 points
- Mid Contribution: up to 7,350 points
- Low Contribution: up to 525 points

**Milestone 3: Creating an Intuitive User Experience**

- *Benchmark: Addition of: 1) multi-interface UI with upload screen and 2) intuitive spreadsheet view for easier disambiguation, understanding of MDTs, and citation assignment*
- High Contribution: up to 15,000 points
- Mid Contribution: up to 7,000 points
- Low Contribution: up to 500 points

**Milestone 4: Achieving V1**

- *Benchmark: Full essential specs as outlined in the GitHub repo completed, including user facing live statistics, misuse alerting, and multiple disambiguation options*
- High Contribution: up to 15,750 points
- Mid Contribution: up to 7,350 points
- Low Contribution: up to 525 points

### Participation Payout

Users who have contributed to multiple milestones will receive bonus points. These points vary depending on contribution type (High, Mid, or Low) and are made per Milestone. Points within the same contribution category per Milestone do not stack; that is, a user who makes >1 Low Contribution in the same Milestone only receives the Low Contribution amount once.

**Participation Payout per Milestone *if* contributions are made to >1 Milestone:**

- High Contribution: 250 points
- Mid Contribution: 150 points
- Low Contribution: 50 points

**Example 1:**

User makes the following contributions: Milestone 1 High Contribution (250 points), and Milestone 2 Low Contribution (150 points). The user's Participation Payout would be 400 points.

**Example 2:**

User makes the following contributions: Milestone 1 Low Contribution (50 points), Milestone 2 Low Contribution (50 points), Milestone 3 Mid Contribution (150 points), and Milestone 4 Low Contribution (50 points). The user's Participation Payout would be 300 points.
