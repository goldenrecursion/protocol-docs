## Contributing data and datasets

Contributing a dataset to the Golden protocol is a way users can help build a dense and useful knowledge graph quickly without dealing with ETL complexity or learning to code. We incentivize the collection of accurate, public, canonical data that has the potential to be successfully submitted into the graph.&#x20;
