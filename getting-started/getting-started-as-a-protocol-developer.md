# Getting started as a protocol developer

## Steps TL;DR

1. Connect to the dApp by following [accessing-the-dapp.md](../protocol/guides/accessing-the-dapp.md "mention") to understand the current state of the protocol.&#x20;
2. Read the [README (2).md](<../README (2).md> "mention") to get familiar with the basic protocol mechanics.
3. View the [Golden Github](https://github.com/goldenrecursion) repositories.&#x20;
4. Explore the available guides, [data schema](https://dapp.golden.xyz/schema), [apps-and-demos.md](../data-and-tools/apps-and-demos.md "mention"), datasets, and posts.&#x20;



## Contribute to open-source repositories

### See [open-source-development.md](../protocol/open-source-development.md "mention") for how to get involved.&#x20;



## Suggest mechanics on the forum

Help create a strong knowledge graph and protocol economy, by proposing protocol mechanics on the Golden forum. Successful proposals or detailed intellectual contributions may earn testnet points rewards.&#x20;

We are especially interested in mechanics proposals on anti-gaming, IP ownership, long-term incentivization, or other core functionality.  See [how-to-get-involved](../protocol/how-to-get-involved/ "mention") for more specific open tasks to solve.&#x20;
