# Getting started in governance and community

## Steps TL;DR

1. Connect to the dApp by following [accessing-the-dapp.md](../protocol/incentivized-testnet-activities/accessing-the-dapp.md "mention") to understand the current state of the protocol.&#x20;
2. Read the [readme-2](../protocol/readme-2/ "mention") to get familiar with the basic protocol mechanics.
3. Read the [predicate-improvement-process.md](../governance/predicates/predicate-improvement-process.md "mention") to understand the process for schema changes. &#x20;
4. [Join the forum](https://forum.golden.xyz/), where proposals can be made with more nuanced discussion. &#x20;
5. [Join Discord](https://discord.com/invite/golden-protocol), introduce yourself and mention what you are interested in working on.



## Suggest proposals on the forum

Help create a strong knowledge graph and protocol economy, by proposing protocol mechanics on the Golden forum. Successful proposals or detailed intellectual contributions may earn testnet points rewards.&#x20;

We are especially interested in mechanics proposals on anti-gaming, IP ownership, long-term incentivization, or other core functionality. See [how-to-get-involved](how-to-get-involved/ "mention") for more specific open tasks to solve.&#x20;

## Improve the protocol's data schema

In order to create a large and useful knowledge graph, a data schema must be created to allow for triples to be submitted and disambiguated. Community members may suggest new predicates be added to the data schema by adding a new proposal on the forum.&#x20;
