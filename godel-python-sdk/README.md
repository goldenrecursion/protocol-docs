# Godel (Python SDK)

The Golden community highly encourages data-oriented developers to efficiently and optimally submit data to the knowledge graph protocol.

In order to help agents and developers programmatically submit data via the GraphQL API, Golden has provided an official open source Python SDK called Godel that provides tools like an API wrapper and web3 utility modules.

The following pages will provide additional guides and walkthroughs for ingesting data in the form of python code to help developers submit accurate and valuable data to Golden's protocol.

## Overview

The [Golden protocol](https://golden.xyz/) provides users with the opportunity to query from and contribute towards building the world's most extensive decentralized graph of canonical knowledge.

Godel is Golden's open-source Python SDK that will provide developers and agents with the tools and means to build applications and extend Golden's protocol.

Godel's repository includes a python package and software to help provide developers with an API wrapper, data processing framework, and web3 utility toolkit for programmatic data query and ingest.

## Docker Setup

Run `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up`.

Go to `localhost:8888` to run our tutorials in jupyter lab.

Images are built with data processing and compute in mind to aid users in their validation and ingest queries.
