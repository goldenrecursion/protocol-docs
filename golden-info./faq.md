# FAQ

**Q. Why is Golden the right team to attempt this?**

A. Golden’s team has crypto enthusiasts dating back to 2011, some being early users and supporters of BTC. Golden investors have also been at the heart of many crypto projects we see in the market today.

**Q. What can you do that is useful right now?**

A. \[Note: this section will go into a lot more detail once we can open up more]

1. [Join our discord](https://discord.gg/28QcktsGmG) and invite like minded people to [golden.xyz](https://golden.xyz).
2. Figure out how you can add value to the project.
3. Standby for the whitepaper, DApp on testnet and Golden team communications.
4. Provide feedback! We are seeking specialists for improving and building the protocol.

**Q. How will airdrops work?**

A. At this time, airdrops will be awarded based on number of novel triples submitted and accepted. Airdrops may also be awarded for high quality ideas, solutions on the protocol itself.

**Q. I see** [**Golden.com**](http://golden.com) **- is that the main interface? Will a DApp be released?**

A. We will release a minimal dApp on a testnet with a focused UI around submission of triples, creation of entities and validation. If the dApp provides value beyond the underlying protocol as a user-friendly means of interacting with the knowledge graph (and earning tokens) we will promote it to mainnet. In the meantime you can use [Golden.com](http://golden.com) \[currently web2 but investigating a web3 retrofit into it as an alternative to dApp] to understand how Golden approaches building and interacting with knowledge graphs. Please follow up [writing guide](https://www.notion.so/Writing-Guide-1e96be6c4c4742a288a142dbc212248c) if you make edits on Golden.com - airdrops will be done to accounts that have done high quality additions of triples (always follow the writing guides), not to low quality edits that don’t follow the guide. Low quality edits that break the writing guide will harm future reputation of accounts. Please see the FAQ further below for more detailed instructions here.

**Q. I’m using** [**Golden.com**](http://golden.com) **to edit topics. Will this work count?**

A. Currently [Golden.com](http://golden.com) has not been fitted with the protocol standards but you can improve the data there if you wish. We will be airdropping previous work that has been done there as well where appropriate, for example, around adding what will be validated triples. Golden.com currently only supports English language. Do not put non-English into [golden.com](http://golden.com) at this time. We will not be awarding airdrops for contributions of natural language (prose or article writing) at this time or formatting changes but rather addition of triples that get validated. You can do this generally in our infobox editor. To be clear editing on Golden.com has not been customized to handle the protocol at this point in time and we are working on a Dapp. We have indicated as of Feb 16th 2022 that article writing not be included in contributing to airdrops due to issues with low quality article edit volume. Instead we are focusing on triples (the facts going into infoboxes) that go on to be validated by the protocol. So please make sure if you enter data into Golden that it is not only correct, but focused around what the protocol will be initially validating. Also pay attention to the definitions of the predicates as well and prior norms in the data. The upcoming Dapp will attempt to make this process easier. Also note, we have a legacy point system on Golden.com which will not be used as part of any airdrops. We are interested in derisking the initial model of triple validation, so airdrops for data work will be in that area.

**Q. Do I need to connect a Wallet to** [**Golden.com**](http://golden.com) **to edit topics?**

A. Yes, Golden requires a Wallet connection to edit topics on [Golden.com](http://golden.com). Review our [Wallet connection documentation](https://www.notion.so/Connecting-a-Wallet-to-Golden-com-8cc2addc89f14e8eab4c6d522fada13c) to learn how to connect your Wallet to Golden.com.

**Q. Do I need to paste the edit I have done into discord?**

A. No. We have full logs of all edits being made.

**Q. Will any contribution to** [**golden.com**](http://golden.com) **count for any future airdrop?**

A. No. We are focused on triples that go onto be validated. Natural language, prose in the article will not count at this time (due to low quality edit volume flooding the site).

**Q.** **When will Golden token be released?**

A. A testnet token will be released alongside the first version of our dApp, and the dApp will use this testing token initially until the economy is balanced, secured and understood. We have much building and testing to be done so there is no current ETA on promotion to mainnet at this time but it is in our plans to do so. We will work on converting this into a better ETA as we get further along building the protocol.

**Q. I’m a developer and want to be involved in the open source components, what should I do?**

A: Hold on tight and let us know in the introductions channel in discord. We will be opening up areas to get community help and reward where appropriate.

**Q. If I submit validated triples or triples that go on to be validated into Golden’s Dapp \[not released yet] while on testnet will I get tokens.**

A: We will airdrop valid participants appropriately. Before we have the Dapp out, please follow the editing and writing guides if you make edits on our classic site of Golden.com

**Q. I’m a protocol developer, whitepaper editor or otherwise, what shall I do?**

A. We are very interested in the early seed of core developers of the protocol from the code perspective, architecture and whitepaper mechanics and mathematics. Please get in touch if you can help.

**Q. I’m a data scientist or AI engineer that wants to bulk load triples in, when can I do that?**

A. We are first working on the ability to take in triples on the Dapp and then will open more bulk methods to scale that will be interfaceless potentially.

**Q. When are other languages going to be supported?**

A. We want to prove the unit economics and security of the system first in the language of our original team \[English]. If it works we want to open up to multiple languages (as it should be!). Please don’t make edits at this point in non english as we don’t support it yet.

**Q. I want to be a mod in discord, how should I approach Golden?**

A. We are still configuring discord for more mass scale so DMing team members will only slow the protocol development down. However, long term, we are interested in mods and have a backlog to verify and setup systems around it. If you have experience in this area please add to your introductions in the introductions channel and we will see it. We are booting up moderators in a careful way to prevent security issues.

**Q. If I add a citation to a triple on** [**Golden.com**](http://golden.com) **will I get an airdrop as well?**

A. Yes. Adding valid citations to any triple that is missing a citation will qualify for a special airdrop as well. This will help these triples become validated. This should be focused around triples that are not URL predicates, especially triples added after the launch of [golden.xyz](http://golden.xyz) but before citations on triples were launched.
