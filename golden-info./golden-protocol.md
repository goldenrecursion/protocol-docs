# Golden Protocol

Welcome to a public facing doc explaining the project status and goals.

**NOTE: Document is a work in progress and improving over time.**

**Background on the company, project and protocol**

Golden [started](https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/) as a [web2 company](https://golden.com/wiki/Golden-5R) in San Francisco on a mission to map all human knowledge. It [raised $20m](https://golden.com/blog/golden-raises-14-5m-series-a-led-by-a16z/) from leading VCs and investors ranging from a16z to Balajis to Founders Fund and many others. Over time, [Golden opened up more of its platform to the public](https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden-open/) to accelerate growth and increase access to the knowledge graph. Golden has come to realize that a better model would be a web3 protocol that allows for incentivization via tokenization of the platform and movement to a permissionless protocol that decentralizes building their vision: open access to canonical knowledge for the public and monetization of that data for use by companies.

In late 2021, the team started to design a web3 version of Golden to increase the speed that the knowledge graph could be built and are now in the early development phase.

**Early beginnings**

We are working on the [protocol](https://golden.xyz/), prioritizing building, testing and whitepaper writing at this time. Our discord community has exploded recently and we are taking actions to best manage, connect and help the new members. We have been selectively sharing the whitepaper with individuals based on previous experience and genuinely good ideas that predict issues of such a protocol. We hope to open up for more community development and feedback as soon as we can.

**While the whitepaper is being made, what’s the TLDR on the whitepaper and protocol?**

Essentially there are a few aspects we are interested in exploring:

1. **Tokens for triples:** Tokens will be given to submitters and validators (who are staked) of fact triples (the atomic knowledge unit), e.g. _‘Apple’ ‘was founded in’ ‘1976’_. Validation will occur given a statistically scored threshold among a consensus of validators in addition to a score derived from the knowledge graph itself. Over time, the graph will reduce the validator workload by providing inference on the correctness of a triple being submitted. Submitters and validators both can gain reputation in the system and earn tokens as each triple becomes accepted. Voting will be blind and validation transparent. The protocol will be generally open source to provide maximum validation transparency, security and connection to the upgrades of the community.
2. **NFTs to represent entity based data and rev share incentives:** We will use NFTs to house payloads of canonical data associated with an entity including triples, natural language in various translations, canonical images, or otherwise. These NFTs will assist with disambiguation (which is a crux problem of knowledge graphs) and provide fractionalized ownership for the submitters, validators and protocol. Future revenue share from commercial data usage can be attached to these and distributed to the creators of the data. Enforcement of commercial usage copyright while maintaining free and open public usage can be implemented as smart contracts.
3. **How will the quality of the knowledge graph be maintained?** The whitepaper will cover anti-gaming issues and balancing economics of incentives. Community governance is also being planned and designed to create a flexible but focused protocol for storing all of human knowledge.
4. **What is going on chain?** A spectrum of solutions exists between triples being stored on chain to just transactions and positions in between e.g. pointing to sets of triples, or validation on chain are being considered. We are investigating the pros and cons of transaction fees against the on-chain utility of data or validation components and dynamics of such systems.

Here is a basic diagram of what we are proposing:
