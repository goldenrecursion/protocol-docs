# Predicate Composition

Predicates on Golden are made of two parts: the predicate configuration and a predicateâ€™s usage details. Together they make up the full predicate definition.

The predicate configuration is the on-chain representation of the predicate. It defines the data types, allowable values, and more. Once created, the predicate configuration should rarely (if ever) need editing.

The usage details for a predicate shows the appropriate and inappropriate usage of that predicate within the Golden Knowledge Graph. The usage details are stored as Markdown files in a GitHub repository. They are stored in this manner because they are expected to need editing over time, as the community encounters different use cases and differences in how a predicate can and should be applied.
