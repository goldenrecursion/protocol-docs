# Predicate Naming Convention

## Capitalization Rules

> Predicates should use title case capitalization as outlined by the AMA Manual of Style. 

### Main Rule

> Major words are capitalized and minor words are lowercase.

**Major words:** Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, subordinating conjunctions, and 4+ letter words

**Minor words:** Coordinating/correlative conjunctions, short prepositions, articles, and <3 letter words

### Additional Rules

**Capitalize the following:**
* The first word
* Every letter of an acronym
* Second word when a virgule (/) is used and it is a major word
* Major words in parentheses
* Both the verb and the particle of a phrasal verb

**Lowercase the following:**
* “To” in infinitives
* Second part of a hyphenated word unless it is a major word

## Other Rules
    
* Predicates for web addresses should use URL (e.g. “Repository URL”) and not other words such as “Link.”
