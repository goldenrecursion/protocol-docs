# About Golden

Golden is building a permissionless, open-source [protocol](https://golden.xyz/) that incentivizes the collection and verification of canonical knowledge. The knowledge graph will be publicly accessible for free, while commercial usage will require payment. Golden [started](https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/) as a [web2 company](https://golden.com/wiki/Golden-5R) in San Francisco on a mission to map all human knowledge. We have [raised $60m](https://golden.com/blog/golden-raises-40m-series-b/) from leading VCs and investors including a16z Crypto, Balaji, Founders Fund, and many others. Since the fall of 2021, we have been focused on creating a decentralized protocol to increase the speed that the knowledge graph can be built.
