# Citations

Citations are evidence attached to statements submitted to the protocol. Citations increase verification efficiency, provide a resource for further reading, and permanently reference the evidence used to verify a claim with that claim.\
\
Some triples may not need citations at this point in time - such as URL triples or UID triples, where the UID or URL can be used to form a citation (see [CIK number](https://dapp.golden.xyz/predicate/78142d14-3ffa-4250-a92a-23f6bfceca62) for an example).\
\
Currently, triples with citations are being prioritized for verification on the dApp.
