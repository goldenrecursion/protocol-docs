# Validation

Triples that are submitted to the protocol need to be checked by validators who form an agreement on whether each triple should be accepted or not.

After enough validations have been cast on a triple to pass the protocol's voting requirements, an agreement (or 'consensus vote') is reached. Validators who voted in the same way as the consensus vote will be rewarded testnet points, while validators who voted against the consensus vote will have their testnet points slashed.\
\
Later on, validators who vote in the same way as the consensus will be eligible to receive revenue share in the validated triple's subject entity through an NFT.
