2. Connect your Ethereum wallet to the dApp ([connecting-a-wallet-to-dapp.golden.xyz.md](connecting-a-wallet-to-dapp.golden.xyz.md "mention"))
3. If your Ethereum address is not connected to a [Golden.com](https://golden.com) account, or you do not yet have a Golden.com account you will be directed to create one.
   1. Sign up for a Golden.com account

   3. [add-wallet-to-golden.com.md](../../general-information/add-wallet-to-golden.com.md "mention") (with the same ETH address as used on the dApp)

Note: There is an initial verification period for new users. During this period you will be tested on your ability to perform high-accuracy verifications. You may not see your testnet points increase relative to the number of verifications that you have performed. After successfully passing this period you will receive a notification and be allocated an Initial Testnet Point Reward.
