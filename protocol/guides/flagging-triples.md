# Flagging

## What does flagging do?

Flagging allows protocol users to alert there is an exceptional reason for data or a specific user to be inspected. Flagging is not an incentivized action, but rather provides good actors an opportunity to improve the quality of the knowledge graph. Users can flag triples and users from the dApp or protocol API.

## Types of triple flags

#### High-Risk URLs

_Links that are misleading or deceptive to their visitors - such as those leading to scams or phishing._

#### Spam

_Unwanted statements submitted with ulterior motives, such as advertising, spreading false information, or otherwise damaging the protocol or agents contributing to the protocol._

#### Factually Incorrect Data

_Data that is known to be factually incorrect, as verified by an alternate citation source claiming that the statement is incorrect._

## Types of user flags

#### **Repetitive Bad Faith Voting**

_This user repetitively votes incorrectly for their personal gain and to the detriment of the protocol._

**Submitting many incorrect triples**

_This user is submitting spam, risky links, or factually incorrect data in bulk._

**Colluding with other wallet addresses**

_This user is colluding with a group of wallet addresses to vote incorrectly._

**Other**

_This user is performing a different action that is detrimental to the protocol._

## **FAQ**

* What happens after I flag a triple or user?
  * Flags will be recorded. Later, flagging events can be made available for those looking to build with protocol data.
  * The 'Factually Incorrect Data' flag will be used to bootload the future re-verification mechanic in the protocol.
