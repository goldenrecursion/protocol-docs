# How to get involved

#### We welcome you to help define and build meaningful parts of the Golden protocol. Below we have identified projects and concepts of high value to the protocol's development.  Working on these projects may make you eligible to earn testnet points; see the guidelines on [incentivized activities](https://goldenhq.notion.site/Golden-Incentivized-Testnet-Activities-de4142e2be0f45fe97e6c6db1009a767).&#x20;
