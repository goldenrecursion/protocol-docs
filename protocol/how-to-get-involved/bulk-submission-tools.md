# Bulk submission tools

### Background

Data entry tools should be as efficient as possible to maximize the rate information can be added to the protocol. Specifically, the development of approachable submission tools for human agents are of high value as they can be used broadly by all.

### Unsolved questions and specific tasks

* \[Open Question] What is the best form factor for fast and accurate data entry? This could be a workflow, such as using excel, or a fully custom tool.&#x20;
  * How can these tools render and implement [minimum-disambiguation-triple-requirements-mdt.md](../concepts/minimum-disambiguation-triple-requirements-mdt.md "mention")?
* \[Open Question] What is the optimal workflow for a by-hand user to add new entities or triples to the protocol?
* \[Task] create extensible, open source tools that allow for dataset importing (such as CSV).
  * Importing should utilize &#x20;
* \[Task] create methods to help improve accuracy, check for duplicates, or auto-fill empty triples.

Having users be able to submit information at a faster&#x20;
