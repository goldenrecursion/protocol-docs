# IP Ownership

### What role does IP ownership have in the protocol?

Intellectual Property ("IP") ownership could be tied to NFT ownership to create further long-term incentives to contribute data. The protocol could charge commercial users for the usage of data in the protocol, and still allow free usage of the data for non-commercial users. We are curious to open up a conversation with the community on different ways that IP can be leveraged, shared, assigned, or otherwise used in the protocol.

### Unsolved questions

* \[Open Question] Should IP ownership for a specific entity be owned by the Golden protocol DAO or NFT holders?
* \[Open Question] What commercial use cases for the usage of IP around entities?
* \[Open Question] What would community enforcement of copyright around the IP look like?
* \[Open Question] Is there a specific commercial license that should be used around IP? Is there an opportunity for a new commercial license specific to IP in the Golden Protocol?
