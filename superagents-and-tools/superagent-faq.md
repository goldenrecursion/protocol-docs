# Superagent FAQ

### Are superagent triple submission and validation tasks rewarded the same as UI additions?

Yes, method of content addition or validation is not a determining factor for earning rewards.



### Is there a way to target a specific predicate type to validate?

We understand that many superagents will be tuned to work only on specific predicate types. Currently, a random unvalidated triple is assigned to each wallet during the validation process, with the choice to skip, accept, or reject. This process will be improved as testnet development continues.&#x20;
